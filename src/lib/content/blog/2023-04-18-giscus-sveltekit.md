## Markdown Examples

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

I just love **bold text**.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

## Code Examples

### Inline Code

Here is some inline code `console.log('Hey I'm inline-code')`
### No Highlighting

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import { Url } from '$lib/url'
	export let data

	const { posts } = data
</script>

<svelte:head>
	<title>Cesar Mejia's Web Portfolio</title>
	<link rel="canonical" href={$page.url.href} />
</svelte:head>

<div>
	<ul>
		{#each posts as post (post.slug)}
			<li class="mb-4"><a class="unstyled" href={Url.BlogDetail(post.slug)}>{post.title}</a></li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
</div>
```

### With Highlighting

```js {5-7a,3a,4a, 2r, 10n, 12n}
export async function load({ fetch }) {
	const variable = "this is a super long variable declaration come on"
	const res = await fetch(`/posts.json`)
	if (res.ok) {
		const { posts } = await res.json()
		return { posts }
	}
}

const code = 'yay!'

const code = 'yay!'
```

### With Focus
```ts {4-6f}
export async function load({ fetch }) {
	const variable = "this is a super long variable declaration come on"
	const res = await fetch(`/posts.json`)
	if (res.ok) {
		const { posts } = await res.json()
		return { posts }
	}
}

const code = 'yay!'

const code = 'yay!'
```
